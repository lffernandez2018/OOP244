1. How many elements are there in each C-style character string that stores a
family or given name for the account? Why?

*There 41 elements in each string that stores family or given name. The array of string can only accept up to 40 elements since
the last character of a string array is a null character (\0). That is why we add 1 extra space for the null character.

2. Your class declares two member functions named set(...). In C, this would
generate an error. Name the feature of C++ that allows this

*We can define multiple functions with the same function name in c++.
This feature of c++ is called Function Overloading.
We can have multiple functions with same function name as long as the types and/or number of arguments of each functions are different.

3. What have you learned during this workshop?

I learned the difference between class and struct in this workshop 
and also learned how to define private object of a class type to the empty state.


Quiz 3 Reflection:

*
The compiler stores the member function instructions separately and only once for all objects of the class.

I answered FALSE but the corrected answer is TRUE. 
If a class have multiple objects, the member functions intructions are only stored once and stored separately by the compiler 
for all the objects of the class
