1. Why does the copy assignment operator check for self-assignment before
doing anything else?
* To avoid objects to be assign to themselves and avoid deallocation of the memory holding the resource data of the object.
If deallocation of the object resource happens, we would lose access to the object resource thus our assignment logic will fail.

2. List how you avoided duplication of code.
Since the contructor with three parameters, the copy constructor, and copy assignment operator have almost the same definition,
I create a new function called init(), that accepts three parameters and does not return anything. I called this function in the contructor with three parameters, copy constructor, 
and copy assignment operator implementation. Thus, avoiding code duplication.

3. List what you have learned in completing this workshop.
I learned how copy constructor, and copy assignment operator works, and to avoid code duplication as possible.


Quiz 6 Reflection:
1. The default copy constructor and the default copy assignment operator does shallow copy.
* answer: TRUE
2. To connect a file to an existing file object, we call the is_open() member function on the object. 
* answer: False
To connect a file to an existing file object, we call the open() member function on the object.
