1. What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty
state?

*The safe empty state means that the initial value of the data members are not junk. 
Without initializing the data members to a safe empty state, the default values of the data members would be junk characters.
If the value of the data members are 0 or '\0', it means that they are in safe empty state.

2. Describe how you have minimized code duplication

*I define function setSafe(), which initialize the data members to the safe empty state that I can use multiple times throughout the program.
Since there are 3 Constructor, I can just call setSafe() function 3 times. 
This minimizes code duplication and hence, made my code relatively shorter.

3. Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the private data of the object referenced in its parameter.

* The object has type Passenger. The canTravelWith(..) function is a member function of class Passenger and has access to the private data members of the class Passenger.
Member functions has access to the data members of the same class or struct.

4. What statement do you need to add to ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes correctly?

* To ensure that the strncpy(...) function executes accurately, We need to include the cstring header file.
Since strncpy(...) function definition is in cstring header file.
#include <cstring>

5. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.
I learned how to initialize data members into safe empty state, to use constructor, to overload constructor, and to use existing codes to avoid code duplication.


Quiz 4 Reflection:

* I got 10/10.
