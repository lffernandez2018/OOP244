1. The operator+ returns a Fraction object. Explain why this operator should
not return a reference to a Fraction object.

*The data type of operator+ is Fraction and not Fraction&. Therefore, it cannot return a reference to a Fraction object. Furthermore, the function of operator+ is just a query.
It does not change or modified values so it doesn't return a reference to a Fraction object.

2. List the temporary objects in the tester module.

*In my operator+ and operator* implementation, I declare a temporary object called obj. 

3. List the simplifications that you made to your class to minimize duplication

* I created a public member function isEquals(const Fraction& obj1, const Fraction& obj2) const. It has bool as return type and receives an unmodifiable reference to two Fraction Objects.
I used this function for operator== and operator!=. Since both function compare two objects, isEquals function minimizes code duplication.

4. Explain what you have learned in this workshop.

* In this workshop, I learned to overload operators and access current object within member functions.


Quiz 5 Reflection:

* The copy assignment operator copies data from an existing object to an existing object
- I answered FALSE but the correct answer is TRUE. Only the copy Constructor copies data form an existing object to a new object.
