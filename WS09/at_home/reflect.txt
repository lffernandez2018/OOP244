1. What happens if you try to put your templated functions in Data.cpp? Does
your source code compile if you move all functions to Data.h? Explain.
* When I move all my templated functions in Data.cpp, the compiler encounter an error.
The compiler cannot find the readRow() and the display() functions. At compile time, compiler must see both declaration and definition of templates inorder to be compiled succesfully.

2. Move one templated function into ws9_lab.cpp. Does it work now? Do you
need to define the template function above main(), before it is used, or can
you define it below main()?
*Putting the templated function display(const char* name, const T* data, int n) in the ws9_lab.cpp works fine but the templated function should be define before main() function
so that the compiler can see it.

3. Could you have done this lab without templates, by just overloading your
functions in Data.h to accept integer and double arguments? What is the
advantage of using templates?
* Yes. We can still do this lab without using templates. However, the code will be unecessarily long and there would be repeatition of codes.
Using templates makes the code cleaner and shorter. 

4. Are the following equivalent?
template<class T>
template<typename T>
* Yes, they are equivalent.
