1. What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
* An abstract base class contains one or more pure virtual function and has no implementation
while a concrete class has implementations in all its member functions.


2. Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?
* bool credit(double), bool debit(double), void monthEnd(), and void display(std::ostream&) const.

3. Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
* I learned how to define a pure virtual functions. Create a pure interface abstract base class.
Create concreate classe that derives from a pure interface abstract base class.
